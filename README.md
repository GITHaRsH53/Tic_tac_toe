I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Pygame, featuring three exciting modes: Player vs. Player (PVP), Player vs. Strong AI (Minimax), and Player vs. Random AI (weak AI). 
The Minimax algorithm powers the Strong AI, ensuring optimal gameplay by evaluating all possible moves and minimizing potential losses. The Random AI, on the other hand, adds an unpredictable and relaxed challenge. 
This project showcases my skills in algorithmic thinking, game theory, and user interface development with Pygame. It was a fun blend of logical problem-solving and creative coding to deliver an engaging gaming experience.

The game includes intuitive controls:

R: Reset the game
G: Toggle AI on/off
0: Switch to Random AI
1: Switch to Minimax AI
